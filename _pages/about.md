I am an Economist in the Economics Research Division at [Banco de México](http://www.banxico.org.mx). I have a Ph.D. in Economics from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/academics/economics/), and undergraduate degrees from [Universidad del Rosario](http://www.urosario.edu.co/Facultad-de-Economia/Inicio/). My research uses elements from Urban and Labor economics to study the effects of minimum wages and other place-based policies. 

I am currently working on how city minimum wages reshape commuting and migration in US cities , the effectiveness of hiring credits in North Carolina, the effects of minimum wages on wage distributions in Colombia and the decomposition of multidimensional poverty measures.
