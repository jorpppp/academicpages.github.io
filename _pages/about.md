I am a Research Economist in the Economics Research Division at [Banco de México](http://www.banxico.org.mx). I have a Ph.D. in Economics from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/academics/economics/), and undergraduate degrees from [Universidad del Rosario](http://www.urosario.edu.co/Facultad-de-Economia/Inicio/). My research uses elements from Urban and Labor economics to study the effects of minimum wages and other place-based policies. 

I am currently working on:

* [The effects of minimum wages on prices in Mexico](/research/2020-03-02-mwprices)
* [The estimation of policy effects in panel event studies](/research/2019-8-29-events)
* [How city minimum wages reshape commuting and migration in US cities](/research/2017-10-10-city-minimum-wages) 
* [The effectiveness of hiring credits in North Carolina](/research/2019-5-3-nc-hiring-credits)
* [The effects of minimum wages on wage distributions in Colombia](/research/2019-04-15-minimum-wages-formal-informal)
* [The decomposition of multidimensional poverty measures](/research/2018-03-20-unpacking-the-mpi)
* How changes in local infrastructure change labor market power in Mexico
