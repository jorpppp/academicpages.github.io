---

This course examines identification issues in empirical microeconomics. Focus on the sensible application of econometric methods to empirical problems in economics and policy research -- particularly labor and population economics. The course examines issues that arise when analyzing non-experimental data and provides a guide for tools that are useful for applied research. The course also emphasizes how a basic understanding of theory and institutions can help inform the analysis. By the end of the course, students should have a firm grasp of the types of research designs and methods that can lead to convincing analysis and be comfortable working with large-scale data sets.

Teaching assistant for Professor Kenneth Chay.
