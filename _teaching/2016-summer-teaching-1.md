We are exposed to economic data and statistical analysis wherever we go: at the supermarket through prices and quantities of goods, at school through relative performance and GPAs, and in advertising through comparisons between the new iPhone 6 and a competitorâ€™s model. Understanding the message is not an issue, but being a critical user of that information requires a deeper understanding of statistical methods.

Econometrics: Statistical Tools to Understand Economic Data is a two-week core course that introduces students to crucial statistical concepts and methods to analyze and interpret data. Economics will play a fundamental role throughout this course, as it will provide a pool of examples that we will study. The course is structured in two main blocks: organizing data and probability. Topics covered include: graphic interpretation of data, regression analysis, probability laws, random variables, normal and binomial distributions, sampling distributions, and the central limit theorem.
