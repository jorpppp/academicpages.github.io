excerpt: 'I estimate the effect of the minimum wage on formal wages, informal wages, and employment in Colombia. I exploit an unexpected increase in the real minimum wage during the 1999 Colombian economic crisis to estimate short- term effects of the minimum wage along the distribution of wages in both sectors. I find evidence of wage responses, with a stronger incidence in the formal sector. '

Abstract: I estimate the effect of a real minimum wage increase on formal and informal wages, and on employment in Colombia. For identification, I take advantage of an unexpected increase in the real minimum wage during 1999, arising from lower-than-expected inflation. I compare cities and industries with different incidence of the minimum wage increase. I measure incidence as the percentage of workers whose real minimum wage is between the old and the new real minimum wage before the increase. I find evidence of positive wage responses for wages close to the minimum wage. The results show that wages increase more in the formal than in the informal sector. I do not find that informal wages react to the minimum wage indirectly, through the linkages between the formal and the informal market. I show that employers in both sectors use the minimum as a reference, although they set some wages below it. These results may not be generalizable to other countries or contexts, or to larger minimum wage increases.
