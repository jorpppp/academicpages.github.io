Local minimum wage laws are becoming common across U.S. cities, and their effects may be different from effects of state or nation-wide minimum wage policies. I study the effect of changes in minimum wages on spatial equilibria in local labor markets. Using residence and workplace data for the U.S., I analyze how commuting, residence and work locations change across city and state borders when minimum wages change on either side of the border. I find that areas that increase minimum wages receive less low-wage commuters, with an elasticity of about -0.3. Minimum wage increases are also associated with employment relocation across borders towards the area that did not increase its minimum wage. I formulate a spatial equilibrium gravity model to explain the distribution of workers between low and high minimum wage areas. I calculate counterfactual equilibria with higher minimum wages for US cities considering increases, highlighting the role of commuting and migration responses. About two thirds of the cities considering increases would receive less commuters. These commuting losses are driven by employment relocation, and similar to those suggested by the reduced-form analysis.
