excerpt: ' We analyze accessibility to jobs through different transportation modes and the extent of job spatial mismatch at the intra-urban level. We use data from Medellin from 2012 to 2017 and measure accessibility through a Hansen equation approach. We find that despite of the continuous investment in public transportation and transport infrastructure, spatial mismatch has increased, and it is considerably larger for job seekers and workers using public transport compared to those using private transport.'

Abstract: We analyze accessibility to jobs through different transportation modes and the extent of job spatial mismatch at the intra-urban level. We use data from Medellin from 2012 to 2017 and measure accessibility through a Hansen equation approach. We find that despite of the continuous investment in public transportation and transport infrastructure, spatial mismatch has increased, and it is considerably larger for job seekers and workers using public transport compared to those using private transport.
