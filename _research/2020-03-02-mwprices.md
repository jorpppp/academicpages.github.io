title: "A Sizeable Increase in the Minimum Wage and a Lower VAT: Identifying their Effects on Prices in Mexico"

excerpt: 'In  January  2019,  the  minimum  wage  in  the  Mexican  Border  with  the US increased by a 100%. At the same time, the value-added tax (VAT) rate was halved.  We propose an identification strategy to estimate the effects of the minimum wage and the VAT on prices separately. We find that the increase in the minimum wage is associated with significant increases in the prices of VAT goods, and with smaller, imprecisely estimated increases for Non-VAT goods. The increments in prices due to the minimum wage were more than offset by decreases associated with the VAT, resulting in lower average prices.

With Mariana Calderón, Josué Cortés and Alejandrina Salcedo

In  January  2019,  the  minimum  wage  in  the  Mexican  Border  with  the  United States increased by a 100%. At the same time, the value-added tax (VAT) rate was halved.  We propose an identification strategy that allows us to estimate the effects of the minimum wage and the VAT on prices separately.  We account for differential effects of the minimum wage on prices of goods with and without VAT. We find that the increase in the minimum wage is associated with economically and statistically significant increases in theprices of VAT goods, and with smaller, imprecisely estimated increases for Non-VAT goods, concentrated in food Non-VAT goods. The increments in prices due to the minimum wage were more than offset by decreases associated with the VAT, resulting in average prices that were lower than those that would have been observed in the absence of these policies.
